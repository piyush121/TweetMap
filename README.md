# TweetMap
Built a small application to plot location of tweets containing a user specified hashtag on Google Maps.
An initial prototype has been built. It still needs some optimization but it works perfectly fine.

We have used google fusion table to store and fetch tweets to make things easier.
It is hosted on Amazon Elastic Beanstalk environment and the program to fetch and store tweets is implemented in the same environment environment.
In order to fetch latest tweets we have to run the program manually on AWS machine.
