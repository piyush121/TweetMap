# TweetMap
Building a small application to plot location of tweets containing a user specified hashtag on Google Maps.
An initial prototype has been built. It still need some optimization but it works perfectly fine.
It is hosted on Amazon s2 bucket and the program to fetch and store tweets is deployed under an Amazon elastic beanstalk environment.
In order to fetch latest tweets we have to run the program manually on AWS machine.
Twitter Map is deployed on the following link:
